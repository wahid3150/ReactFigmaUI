# React + Vite

This template provides a minimal setup to get React working in Vite with HMR and some ESLint rules.

Currently, two official plugins are available:

- [@vitejs/plugin-react](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react/blob/main/packages/plugin-react/README.md) uses [Babel](https://babeljs.io/) for Fast Refresh
- [@vitejs/plugin-react-swc](https://github.com/vitejs/vite-plugin-react-swc) uses [SWC](https://swc.rs/) for Fast Refresh




## Hero Section Design and Implementation

### Overview

This project involves the design and implementation of a hero section based on a Figma design using React.js. It was developed as part of a task assigned during my full-stack development course to enhance my skills in front-end development and UI/UX design.

### Features

- **Hero Section**: A responsive hero section with an eye-catching heading, descriptive paragraph, and action buttons.
- **Call-to-Action Buttons**: "Shop Now" and "Category" buttons styled for clear visibility and engagement.
- **Availability Section**: Showcases the product's availability on various platforms with logos for Flipkart and Amazon.
- **Product Image**: A visually appealing product image to attract attention and illustrate the design concept.

### Technologies Used

- **React.js**: For building the interactive and dynamic user interface.
- **CSS**: For styling the hero section and ensuring responsiveness.
- **Figma**: For the initial design and layout planning.

### Project Goals

- To translate a Figma design into a functional and responsive React component.
